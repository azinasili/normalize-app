# normalize-app.scss

Normalize-app.scss builds off of
[normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) with small tweaks made
specifically for web-apps in mind. Normalize-app.scss offers a small set of
settings to make consistent heading typography.

# normalize.css v3

Normalize.css is a customizable CSS file that makes browsers render all
elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.

The project relies on researching the differences between default browser
styles in order to precisely target only the styles that need or benefit from
normalizing.
